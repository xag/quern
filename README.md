# bom — the generic backend substrate

## Why: knowledge that moves as fast as the work

A virtual twin is three things — **semantics** (what the parts mean), **models**
(what must hold between them), **solvers** (what computes over them). In the old
world all three are frozen into software the moment a programme is built. You learn
something while designing — a better way to describe a part, a rule you should have
had, a smarter way to compute a fit — and you cannot apply it to the very programme
that taught it to you without a new release cycle. So the capitalization loop on
knowledge, modeling and best practice runs slow: semantics are fixed in the code,
models are fixed, solvers are fixed. Innovation waits for the next version.

AI dissolves that. Semantics, models and solvers can now be **authored on the go**,
while the design is happening, by the intelligence sitting *at* the work. Not
centralized in the heads of the people who once designed the PLM system, and not
frozen in its code — distributed, like a squid whose intelligence lives in its arms
and can regrow, rather than commanded from a single brain. Meaning is written at the
node that needs it, the moment it is needed, and kept.

That is the premise this substrate is built on. **In bom, all three are data**, not
code — vocabulary you register as you navigate, rules you write against it, solvers
you install behind one bridge — authored at runtime, per tree, by whoever designs
there, and capitalized into versioned packages the next design pins and refines. The
core interprets none of it; it is mechanics and safety only. Innovation and
capitalization become **organic by design**: every endeavor is a research project
that is operative on the go, and the boundary between research and operations
disappears — the model you reason with *is* the model you run. Knowledge no longer
sits still while operations move around it; the two evolve together. With AI at every
node, that is simply the new normal.

## What bom is

The **BOM** — Business Object Model: a tree of typed-by-data objects with a
vocabulary that rules are written against (the pattern BRMS engines like IBM ODM
call a "Business Object Model"), generalized so **semantics are data**, not code.
The `Bom` type is the model — vocabulary, rules, solvers, packages, and a `root`
node tree. The code here is mechanics and
safety only; everything that *means* something is content:

- **Nodes**: free-text `kind`, params (every number is a Quantity: `value`, `unit`,
  `tolerance`, a free-text `provenance` label the domain names, the fixed `grounded`
  predicate — is this an observation you may act on? — plus `source` and
  `derived_from` lineage), named links, optional shape payload, children.
  Path-addressed, partially updatable.
- **Vocabulary**: what kinds mean — prose, registered at runtime, discovered with
  each node you read (`semantics_at`).
- **Rules**: a tiny safe expression language (no eval). Builtins are structural
  (`param`, `nodes`, `params_of`, `count`, `sum`, `len`, `ctx`, `superseded`,
  arithmetic, comparisons, booleans) plus **one bridge to meaning:
  `solve('contract', …)`**.
- **Solvers**: sandboxed WASM (wasmtime: fuel + memory caps, zero imports, no
  clock/net) that *propose* — outputs stamped `derived` with the code hash —
  and never write the tree. Content-addressed blobs; clients may fetch and run
  them locally (same artefact, same ABI).
- **Library**: versioned, immutable packages `{vocabulary, rules, solvers,
  examples}` — publication is proof-gated (rules must be exercised by the
  package's own examples and pass; modules must meet the ABI). A `Bom` pins
  `name@version`; local content always wins over packages.
- **Standard contracts**: `geometry@1` documents shape conventions and solver
  contracts (`geometry/volume`, `bbox_*`, `clearance`, …); the Python here is
  its first-class native implementation, registered behind the same names
  (`register_native`). A native is an optimisation of content, never a
  semantics of its own.

**The core fixes verbs a consumer branches on, never nouns a domain names.** What a
kind *is* stays vocabulary (data); the only meanings frozen into the substrate are
the handful of relations every consumer would otherwise re-implement and get wrong —
`grounded` (may I act on this value?), `supersedes` (which node do we currently
hold?), and `derived_from` (what does this rest on, and what must fall when it
changes?). Provenance was once a fixed four-word epistemics; it is now a free label
plus that one `grounded` predicate — the label is the domain's to name, the verb is
the core's to enforce.

**Evaluation is pure**: rules and solvers see the tree slice and the
caller-supplied `context`, nothing else — every evaluation is deterministic and
replayable (what makes backtesting structural for time-series consumers).

The substrate knows nothing of its consumers. A domain lives entirely outside this
library — as a package (vocabulary, rules, solvers) plus the backend code that
embeds `bom` — and domain safety invariants stay in that consumer code: meaning is
data, safety is code.

Canonical repo: `xag/bom` (private while it hardens). A consumer that vendors it
(e.g. via `git subtree` under some `<prefix>`) syncs with:

    git subtree pull --prefix=<prefix> <remote> main --squash
